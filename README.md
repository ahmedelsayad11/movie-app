THIS app is a practical application using

- react
- react-redux
- redux-saga
- json-server
- bootstrap

\*\* the structure of the folders

i have used the atomic pattern designing the component so you will find an atom folder and molecules folder

\*\*\* for the api
you will find the instance of the api in the api folder as with the api requests

\*\*\* for the redux
i have used redux-saga and separated all the action,action-types,reducer-saga ,in single folder to make the code clearer

\*\* to run this application you should clone it
then

npm run dev

and open another terminal

npm run json-server

the purpose of this command is to run the json server which act as the backend of my application so i can demonstrate the fetch method and the success and failure of the requests
